# 📝 Text Sentiment Analysis using NLTK

## 🚀 Overview
This project performs text sentiment analysis using the NLTK library in Python. It analyzes the sentiments or emotions of words in a given text file by categorizing them into predefined emotion categories. Additionally, it utilizes the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sentiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool to determine the overall sentiment of the text.

## ✨ Features
- **Text Cleaning**: Removes punctuation and converts text to lowercase.
- **Tokenization**: Splits the cleaned text into individual words.
- **Stopword Removal**: Filters out common English stopwords.
- **Emotion Detection**: Matches words with predefined emotions from an emotions file.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines the overall sentiment of the text using VADER sentiment analysis.
- **Visualization**: Generates a bar chart to visualize the distribution of emotions in the text.

## ⚙️ How to Use
1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Python script `sentiment_analysis.py`.
3. Review the output to see the emotions detected and the overall sentiment analysis.
4. Check the generated `Graph.png` for a visual representation of the emotion distribution.

## 🛠️ Directory Structure
- `read.txt`: Input text file for sentiment analysis.
- `emotions.txt`: File containing predefined emotions and associated words.
- `sentiment_analysis.py`: Python script for performing sentiment analysis.
- `Graph.png`: Output graph visualizing emotion distribution.

## 📋 Usage
Before running the script, ensure you have installed the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
